AL Case System Guide

SUMMARY

The AL Case System is a collection of pre-configured components that are easily assembled to create an electronics or utility box that can be easily customized for your needs. With an AL Case all the design and engineering has been done for you â€“ you simply select the size and features you need, print the parts and assemble! It goes together in minutes with minimal hardware and has a variety of options that allows you to customize it for your specific needs.
The first big benefit of the AL Case System is that it provides a fully functional case that can be completely 3D-printed! Up until now if you wanted a project case you would have to search the Internet for a box with the dimensions and shape you need, order it online, wait for it to arrive and you still may not have exactly what you need.
Another big benefit of the AL Case System is it eliminates the tedious work of customizing a standard, off-the-shelf utility box. Stock utility boxes have a cavernous void inside, with no method of mounting things like PCB boards, motors, transformers, etc. And to mount a switch or display to the shell you need to drill, hacksaw and Dremel into the brittle plastic that easily chips. The AL Case System solves this problem and simplifies customization in four ways: 1) Since the sides, top and bottom are removeable you can mechanically modify a single component at a time and simply reprint the piece if you make a mistake, 2) you can 3D design and print your own sides that are exactly tailored with the cutouts or mounts your customization requires, 3) you can take advantage of the extensive and flexible mounting options that are built-in to the AL Case System, and 4) with a large selection of pre-designed customized components available you may find that what you need has already been designed and is ready to download!
Originally designed with electronics projects in mind, the AL Case System is flexible enough to use wherever a general-purpose utility box is needed. And since YOU print the pieces you can chose the size, features, and colors that you want to create your own unique design.
